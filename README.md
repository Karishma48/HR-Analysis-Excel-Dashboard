Exciting News! Introducing My Latest Project: The HR Analytics Dashboard


Hello everyone! I hope you're all doing well.
I’m thrilled to share my latest project, the HR Analytics Dashboard, crafted using the powerful tools in Excel. This dashboard is packed with insights into our employee performance, highlighting key metrics like Total Employees, Average Age, Attrition, Active Employees, and Attrition Rate.
To bring this data to life, I've incorporated a variety of charts:
Matrix Chart: Featuring a Pie Chart showing Department by Attrition and a Column Chart illustrating Attrition by Age Group, all connected through a slicer for easy filtering.
Donut Chart: Showcasing Attrition by Marital Status.
Tree Map: Highlighting Attrition by Job.
Bar Chart: Visualizing Education by Attrition.
Pie Chart: Displaying Gender-wise Total Employees.
This project began with data sourced from Kaggle, followed by a meticulous process of cleaning, organizing, and transforming the data into actionable insights. The addition of slicers enhances interactivity, making the dashboard not just informative but also user-friendly.
The end result is a visually appealing and comprehensive dashboard, designed to provide meaningful insights at a glance. I’d love for you to check it out and share your thoughts
